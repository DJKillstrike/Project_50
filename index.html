                    This traditional origami boat is perfect for a beginner origami project.
                    It's also a wonderful toy, as it can float on water. Fold several to
                    create a bathtub fleet for a child. To make the paper boat move through the
                    water, put a drop of liquid soap at the back of the boat. The changing
                    surface tension will propel the boat forward.

                            These origami fans couldn't be easier to make.
                            They're great decorations for parties and weddings.
                            You can also make little origami earrings with these.
                            Consider making special gifts for friends by using richly
                            patterned chiyogami paper.

                   <p>
                    This origami box, perfect for candy or snacks,
                    is tapered at the top so anything inside will stay put.
                    These take a bit longer than a regular Masu box,
                    but the end result is worth the time. Consider making
                    these as party favors for a special event.

                    This is a nifty origami tissue paper holder
                    for your handbag. It's a cinch to make when you
                    follow the origami diagram. When you're done,
                    use your tissue holder to store folded tissues to be
                    pulled out neatly.
